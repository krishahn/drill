First, check that you [meet the prerequisites]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/embedded-mode-prerequisites), including setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and then install Drill. Currently, Drill supports 64-bit Windows only. Complete the following steps to install Drill:

1. Download the latest version of Apache Drill:  [http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-1.4.0.tar.gz](http://getdrill.org/drill/download/apache-drill-1.4.0.tar.gz)
2. Move the downloaded file to a directory where you want to install Drill.
3. Unzip the GZ file using a third-party tool. If the tool you use does not unzip the underlying TAR file as well as the GZ file, perform a second unzip to extract the Drill software. The extraction process creates the installation directory containing the Drill software. 

At this point, you can [start Drill]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/starting-drill-on-windows).
